The difference between b"hello" and "hello" in Rust lies in their types and representation:

1. b"hello": This is a byte string literal
2. It is of type &[u8; 5] and directly represents the bytes of the string in ASCII
3. Each character in b"hello" is converted to its corresponding ASCII value at compile time
4. For example, 'h' becomes 104, 'e' becomes 101, and so on.

1. "hello": This is a regular string literal and is of type &str
2. It represents a UTF-8 encoded string. While UTF-8 and ASCII have the same representation for standard English characters
3. &str can also contain Unicode characters, which &[u8] from a byte string literal cannot.

In summary, b"hello" is a byte array with ASCII values, while "hello" is a UTF-8 encoded string slice.
